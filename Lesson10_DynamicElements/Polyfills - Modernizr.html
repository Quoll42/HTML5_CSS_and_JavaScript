    <p>A polyfill is a browser fallback, made in JavaScript, that allows functionality you expect to work in modern browsers to work in older browsers, e.g., to support canvas (an HTML5 feature) in older browsers.</p>
    See <strong><a href="https://modernizr.com/docs">https://modernizr.com/docs</a></strong> regarding how you can check if you need to dynamically revert to a polyfill. It also has polyfills.
